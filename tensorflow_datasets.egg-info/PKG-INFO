Description: tensorflow/datasets is a library of public datasets ready to use with
        TensorFlow. Each dataset definition contains the logic necessary to download and
        prepare the dataset, as well as to read it into a model using the
        `tf.data.Dataset` API.
        
        Usage outside of TensorFlow is also supported.
        
        See the README on GitHub for further documentation.
